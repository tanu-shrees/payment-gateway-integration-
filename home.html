        An Indian social development organization, is directly benefitting over 15 lakh children and their families every year. We have more than 400 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood, and womenâ€™s empowerment in over 2,000 remote villages and urban slums across 25 states of India.

        The groundwork for a better life lies in education. It is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. However, a child cannot be educated in isolation. Only an empowered family, especially the mother, would be willing to educate their child. Thus, rather than focusing on only one stage of a person's life, we believe in the lifecycle approach.
        
        Education empowers an individual to earn their livelihood and also increases one's awareness on a range of issues.
